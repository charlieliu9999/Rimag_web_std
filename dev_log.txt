- Initialized Git repository.
- Started addressing UI issues: logo display and hero text visibility.

2024-07-30T08:15:00Z
- Analyzed index.html and styles.css.
- Modified hero section styles in css/styles.css:
    - Changed text color of .main-title, .sub-title, .hero-text to var(--text-color) (#333333) for better contrast.
    - Adjusted .hero-overlay to a light semi-transparent white (rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7)) to match the visual and ensure text readability.
    - Removed text-shadows and animations from hero text for simplification.
- No changes made to logo as current CSS (white navbar background, dark blue logo text) should provide good visibility. Awaiting further clarification if logo issue persists.

- Addressed logo text wrapping issue.
- Applied `flex-shrink: 0;` to `.logo` class in `css/styles.css` to prevent it from shrinking in the navbar's flex container, ensuring sufficient width for the logo text.
- Added `min-width: 180px;` to `.logo` for extra protection.

- Increased .form-control padding to 1.5rem, then switched to underline style for input fields as per user feedback.

2024-07-30T09:00:00Z
- Updated testimonial (医院反馈) section in index.html to use card style with large quote icon and right-aligned author.
- Added corresponding .testimonial-card, .testimonial-quote, .testimonial-author styles in css/styles.css for improved visual effect.

2024-07-30T09:15:00Z
- User reported no visible change to form input height with 0.875rem padding.
- Changed `.form-control` padding to `1.5rem` in `css/styles.css` for a more noticeable effect, as requested by user.

2024-07-30T09:30:00Z
- User reported no visible change to form input height even with 1.5rem padding.
- As per user request, changed `.form-control` style to use an underline instead of a full border.
    - Removed existing border and border-radius.
    - Added `border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);`.
    - Set `background-color: transparent;`.
    - Adjusted `padding` to `0.75rem 0.25rem;`.
    - Updated `:focus` styles for underline (color and width change).
