- Initialized Git repository.
- Started addressing UI issues: logo display and hero text visibility.

2024-07-30T08:15:00Z
- Analyzed index.html and styles.css.
- Modified hero section styles in css/styles.css:
    - Changed text color of .main-title, .sub-title, .hero-text to var(--text-color) (#333333) for better contrast.
    - Adjusted .hero-overlay to a light semi-transparent white (rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7)) to match the visual and ensure text readability.
    - Removed text-shadows and animations from hero text for simplification.
- No changes made to logo as current CSS (white navbar background, dark blue logo text) should provide good visibility. Awaiting further clarification if logo issue persists.

- Addressed logo text wrapping issue.
- Applied `flex-shrink: 0;` to `.logo` class in `css/styles.css` to prevent it from shrinking in the navbar's flex container, ensuring sufficient width for the logo text.

2024-07-30T08:45:00Z
- Logo text wrapping issue persisted after `flex-shrink: 0`.
- Applied `min-width: 180px;` to `.logo` class in `css/styles.css` as an alternative fix to ensure sufficient space.

2024-07-30T09:00:00Z
- Logo display issue resolved with `min-width`.
- Addressed contact form input field height: increased padding for `.form-control` in `css/styles.css` from `0.75rem` to `0.875rem` to improve visual height and text spacing.
